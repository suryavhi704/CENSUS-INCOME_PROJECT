🚀 **Census Income Prediction using Machine Learning**
📊 *Predicting whether an individual earns more than \$50K/year based on demographic data*

I'm excited to share my latest Machine Learning project where I worked on the **Census Income Dataset** to build predictive models that classify income levels based on various socio-economic features.

### 🔍 Project Highlights:

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Cleaned and visualized the dataset to uncover key patterns and correlations.
* Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and analyzed feature distributions.

✅ **Model Building & Evaluation:**

* Implemented three core ML algorithms:

  * **Logistic Regression**
  * **Decision Tree Classifier**
  * **Random Forest Classifier**
* Used **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.

✅ **Performance Testing:**

* Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Compared the strengths of each model to determine the most effective approach.

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies:

* Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn
* Scikit-learn | GridSearchCV | Jupyter Notebook

### 📌 Key Takeaways:

This project gave me hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation using real-world data. I also gained deeper insights into how different ML models behave with categorical-heavy datasets.
